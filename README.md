# Carta Investor Services Fellowship Take Home

There are 2 different challenges for you to choose from:

- [The SOI is a frontend challenge.](soi.md)
- [The Portfolio API is a backend challenge.](portfolio-api.md)

Please complete 1 of the 2 available challenges. Put your code in a public github repo and email that back to our team. Please either deploy your project to the internet (Heroku, etc) or include detailed setup instructions so that we can run it locally.

While we think we've scoped our challenges to a reasonable level of complexity for someone to complete in a few hours, feel free to cut down the scope if it helps you focus on quality. If anything seems wrong or confusing, let us know.

Please do not enlist outside help to build these projects, but please use resources/code snippets/examples to help you. Make sure to reach out with any clarifying questions about the directions.

Good luck!
